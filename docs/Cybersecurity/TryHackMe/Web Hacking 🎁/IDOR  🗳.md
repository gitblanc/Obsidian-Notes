- **IDOR** -> Insecure Direct Object Reference, and is a type of access control vulnerability. It can occur when a web server receives user-supplied input (files, data, documents), too much trust has been placed on the input data and it is not validated on the server-side to confirm the requested object belongs to the user requesting it. *Example*: when you try to log in and in the url there is information about the user, so you try to change the code and try to see another user information.
