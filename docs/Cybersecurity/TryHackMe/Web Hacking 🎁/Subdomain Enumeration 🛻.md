W can use this service to discover subdomains belonging to a domain in sites like https://crt.sh and https://transparencyreport.google.com/https/certificates.
- **Search Engines** -> `-site:<www.domain.com> site:*.<domain.com>*`, only contains results leading to the domain name "domain.com" but exclude any links domain.com.
- **BruteForce DNS** -> method that tries thousands of different possible subdomains from a pred-defined list of commonly used domains.
