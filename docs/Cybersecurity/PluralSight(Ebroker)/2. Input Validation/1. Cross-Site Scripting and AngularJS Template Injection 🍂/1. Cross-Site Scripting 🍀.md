- How to steal a password with a **cross-site scripting** attack
- A **Cross-site Scripting** attack (XSS) allows the attacker to do arbitrary scripting in the context of Same Origin Policy (SOP)
- SOP = domain + protocol + port
- Example: pluralsight.com + HTTPS + 443

**What can the attacker do as a result of an XSS attack?**
- Steal a user's password
- Steal a user's authentication cookie
- Read data from a user's account
- Redirect a user to another domain (attacker controlled domain)

**How does XSS works?**
- The attacker-controlled data is returned in the response (e.g in HTML)
- Sanitization is not implemented (there is no HTML encoding)
- XSS attack is possible
- The attacker can steal information
