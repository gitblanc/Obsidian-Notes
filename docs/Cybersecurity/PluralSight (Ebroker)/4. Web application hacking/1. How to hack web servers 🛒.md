# Web server concepts
![](img/Concepts.png)
- **Document root**: top level directory on the web server from which files are served. We can try to break to the Document root to gain access to other documents of the web server. This can be done with a **directory transversal** attack
- **Server root**: top level root directory on the web server which contains the server configuration data, logs as well as executables
- **Web proxy**: software that serves as a buffer or cache between the web server and the client

Popular *web server software*:
- **NGINX**: often deployed as a web server or as a reverse proxy server
- **Apache ATP**
- **Cloudfare**: is also called a reverse proxy because it often stands in fron of other web servers
- **Microsoft's Internet Information Server**

# Web server attacks
*Attack types*:
- **Man in the middle**: attacker between client and server. This is a way to attack the integrity of the messages as well as break the confidentiality
- **Denial of service attack** (DOS): denies a client the access to a web server (flooding a web server, overloading it)
- **Brute force attack**: try a lot of username and passwords until get the one correct
- **Web defacement attack**: you try to modify the website itself so that the visitor see a modified page by the attacker
- **Web cache poisoning**: we first try to empty the cache of the regular site and then we try to inject our version of the site

### Web servers attack methodology:
1. **Web server information gathering** (internet searches, whois searches, gather information about other software it uses)
2. **Web server footprinting** (gather information about the webserver software itself)
3. **Website mirroring** (copy a version of the site to local and perform a deepest analysis, **it is not very used**)
4. **Vulnerability scanning** (with the previous information, try to find vulnerabilities in those parts). For webservers a nice **tool** to find vulnerabilities is **Nikto**
5. **Session hijacking** (take over an existing session by modifying cookie values)
6. **Web server password cracking** (gather the credentials of the administrators)

### General Penetration testing methodology
1. Reconnaissance
2. Find vulnerabilities
3. Exploit vulnerabilities
4. Post exploitation
5. Report

### Web server attack tools
- **Nikto** (scanner quite noisy)
- **Nmap**
- **Metasplot**
- **Docker**

---
You don't necessary need to have locally installed the tools. You can use the tool **docker** to run this tools on a container to increase your security.
````
docker run --rm name_of_image nmap ip_addr #performs a port scan

docker run --rm name_of_image nmap ip_addr #also performs footprinting
````

# Web server attacks countermeasures
- **Applying encryption and certificates** (man in the middle attacks are not possible anymore, all data between client and server will be encrypted)
- **Hardening** (removing default things as accounts)
- **Rate limiting** (for DOS attacks, an ip can just perform a limited number of requests)
- **Patch management** (everything is up-to-date)
- **Network firewall**
- **Network segmentation** (all servers of the enterprise are separated)
