# In practice
- Use ' (character)
- Use " (string)
- Use -- (comment)
- Use ; (query delimiter)

# Types of SQL injection 
There are 2 **channels**:
- **Input**: where you send your SQL statements to (**control channel**)
- **Output**: where will be shown (**data channel**)
- (**side channel**)

**Types**:
- **In-band SQL injection**: we can perform **select** statements and the data will be shown to us. Use data channel for all output
- **Inferential SQL injection**: we can infer what the results were of the SQL statement. We only know wether the query work or didn't work. Use data channel for 1-bit output
- **Out-of-bands SQL injection**: very difficult. Use side channel for output

---
# Exploitation techniques
- **Union-based**: join 2 results together
- **Error-based**: try to force an error to show helpful information
- **Boolean exploitation technique**: try to do a comparison, for instance a character or string comparison
- **Out of band exploitation technique**: uses the side channel to extract or exfiltrate information
- **Tautology exploitation technique**: you can modify the logic of a SQL statement or you can retrieve itrs specific results set

# How to perform SQL injection attack
1. Evaluate input fields
2. Try out characters relevant for the database (' ")
3. Gather information about the database
4. Observe error messages
5. Exfiltrate data

# Automate SQL injection attacks
- Most used tool is **sqlmap**
- We can also use the tool **BurpSuite** and the tool **NoSQLmap** (for non-relational databases)

---
# Perform a SQL injection using sqlmap
- Install sqlmap
- Execute it through Burp Proxy
- Watch results

Notes: python3 and BurpSuite need to be installed

---
# Evasion Techniques
- Insert comments between the keywords
- Use different character encodings
- String concatenation
- Obfuscation
- White space manipulation

---
# SQL injection countermeasures
- Validate input
- Avoid use of dynamic SQL statements
- Prepared statements: useuse parameterized input with stored procedures
- Disable (detailed) error messages
- Use a Web application Firewall
- Log errors
