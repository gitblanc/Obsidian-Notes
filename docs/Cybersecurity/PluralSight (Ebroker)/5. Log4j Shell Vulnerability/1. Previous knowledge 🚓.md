Log4j is a logging framework in Java. It's an open source free framework that you can just wrap into your code and makes everything for you. But there is a bug in this library that allows a vulnerability -> **Log4jjShell**

**Log4jShell** allows an attacker to send a message to a vulnerable application allowing them to execute potenially malicious code

The attacker only needs:
- Prepare the malicious file
- Place it on a server the enterprise controls
- Send some modified text to a field that is being logged by the application server

Once the server logs this string, Log4j will retrieve and execute the malicious code from the attacker's server
