ESSID is the sequence of characters that uniquely identify a wireless local area network (WLAN).

The ESSID can be obtained by **sniffing the wireless environment** and by **de-authentication**

---
How to obtain a hidden ESSID:

- Confirm that the wireless adapter is in monitor mode:
````
airmon-ng 

airodump-ng mon0
````

ESSID is identified only with <length: 9>. This is because its length is composed of 9 characters

- Get its unique BSSID and type:
````
airodump-ng --bssid BSSID mon0
````
The data indicates that there is 1 station connected to the BSSID, which is associated with the hidden ESSID:
