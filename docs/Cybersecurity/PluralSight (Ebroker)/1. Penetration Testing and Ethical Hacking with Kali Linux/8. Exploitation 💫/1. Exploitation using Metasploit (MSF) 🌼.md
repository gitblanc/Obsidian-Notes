MSF Modules:
- **Exploits**: code fragments that target specific vulnerabilities
	- **Active exploits**: will run the vulnerability and then exit
	- **Passive exploits**: wait for incoming hosts and exploit them when they connect
- **Payloads**: malicious code that implements comments inmediatly following a succesful exploitation
- **Auxiliary**: they perform related functions  that support the exploitation phase
- **Post**: they run on compromised targets to gather useful data and pivot the attacker deeper into the target network
- **Encoders**: are used to bypass anti-virus defenses. These modules encode the payload so that it cannot be detected using signature matching techniques
- **NOP**: used to facilitate buffer overflows during attacks

How to use Metasploit
Steps:
- First, create a workspace:
````
service postgresql start

sudo msfdb init #initialize the msf database

msfconsole

workspace #check workspaces

workspace -a new_workspace #add new workspace

search workspace #search a workspace

#if appears this error: [!] Database not connected or cache not built, using slow search, use:
db_rebuild_cache
````

- Search the exploit you want to use:
````
search name_exploit

info name_of_exploit #if you want more info about the exploit
````

- If you like it, use it:
````
use name_of_exploit

show options #for setting the required fields to complete the exploit
````
