We will use the tool **Hashcat**

A page to generate md5 hashes -> https://www.miraclesalad.com/webtools/md5.php

- First we create a .txt with a hash:
````
vim hash.txt
````
- For knowing what kind of hash is it, we have the tool **Hash Identifier**:
````
hash-identifier 

HASH: hash
````

- Now apply hashcat:
````
hashcat -m 0 -a 0 hash_file wordlist_to_use
````
