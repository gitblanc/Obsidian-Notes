# ¬°Welcome!
- If you like this web, give me a üåü on [my Github repo](https://github.com/gitblanc/Obsidian-Notes) :)
- On this page/repository you will find all my knowledge acquired in my career as a Software Engineer at the University of Oviedo. 
- It is a series of notes from multiple subjects made in Markdown
- I put a random emoji every day (they have no meaning)
- For  elaborating them I use [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) (hence the name)
- You can clone, fork or upgrade them, but **not sell** them!

---

## ¬°Donate me!
- If you pay me a skewer for my breaks at the University, know that I love you ‚ù§
